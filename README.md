# George Owen: California Environmental Pollution Atlas

This atlas tracks pollution and athsma rates across California per county by census tract. This is intended for use as a reference to measure correlation between these two variables. Data is represented in a series of choropleth maps for each county of California. Counties are broken into census tracts, and each is shaded based on its pollution / athsma rates relative to other census tracts across California. This lets us compare across counties to examine spatial clustering in variables while still being able to examine individual counties.
